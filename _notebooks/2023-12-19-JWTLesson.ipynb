    "- JSON Web Token (JWT) \n",
    "    - popular way to authenticate users in a web application. It is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS). \n",
    "    - Compact, url safe means of representing claims to securely transmit information between parties.\n",
    "        - These claims are encoded as JSON objects that are digitally signed using a JSON web signature\n",
    "    - Concise and efficient representation, allows for ease of transmissions over networks\n",
    "    - No need to reference external source/database to validate info\n",
    "- Common use cases: \n",
    "    - Authentication\n",
    "    - information exchange\n",
    "    - Authorization\n",
